# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project challenges Data Analytic students to clean up the way data is stored and to analyze the information based on multiple variables. In this example we were to analyze information regarding fundraising goals and visualize raw numbers into clean, readable charts.

### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to correlate success criteria for campaigns based on what time of year Theater campaigns were launched and to break down "successful" outcomes based on the the fund rasing goal.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This graph displays the number of successful, failed, and canceled Campaigns for the category of Theater based on when the campaign was launched.  The number of failed and canceled campaigns are fairly consistent across all months.  However, the months with the most successful campaigns are May through August.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This graph displays the successful, failed, and canceled outcomes as a percentage along with the goal of each campaign based on of how much money they were looking to raise.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I struggled in the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals with having to recreate CountIf code.  It was tedious to have to edit 36 different CountIf statements because I was unable to use the same line for each cell.  I ended up using the same code from the number of successful outcomes and adjusting the statement based on the other two outcomes.
Another challenge I encountered was presenting this Analysis as a READ.md file.  I have never used this platform before so I had to use my Google-Fu skills to read and watch videos on how to successfully navigate this platform. I do see the benefit in the platform based on the structure is similar to coding platforms and will be useful when learning how to write HTML.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
